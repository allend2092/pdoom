# P(DOOM) Calculator

A tongue‑in‑cheek web app that lets you “predict” the probability of AI doom based on the year you think AI will surpass humans.

## How it works
- You enter a future year.
- The app calculates a silly probability using an exponential decay formula – the farther in the future, the lower the probability (because we’re optimistic!).
- The result is displayed instantly in the browser.

## Development roadmap
- **Phase 1** – Simple UI & random‑ish calculation (already implemented).
- **Phase 2** – Add more nuanced factors (e.g., research breakthroughs, policy changes).
- **Phase 3** – Turn it into a game‑like simulation with visualisation of humans vs AI progress.
- **Phase 4** – Multiplayer leaderboards, shareable results, and animated graphics.

## Running locally
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. No build step or server required – it’s pure HTML/JS/CSS.

## Contributing
Feel free to open issues or pull requests to improve the simulation, add features, or make the UI prettier.
